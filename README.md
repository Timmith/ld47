# Break; #

The game theme is: "Stuck in a loop"

The game is about breaking out of loop before loop breaks you. (read in Russian accent)

The game is built on a fork of [github.io](http://bunnybones1.github.io/gmtk-game-jam-2019/index.html)
Playable on [itch.io](https://bunnybones1.itch.io/only-one)

Which is actually a further fork of [Horizon Games' Game Kit A](https://github.com/horizon-games/game-kit-a)
