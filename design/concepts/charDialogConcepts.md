Oh, and on and a dev note:
The main char could be like, a skinny coder Duke Nukem rendition, and his catchphrase/slogan could be: 
"It's time to hammer out some debugging!"
In addition to the large chin and blonde short hair

hahaha
more catch phrases:
"I've reach my breaking point"
TimmithToday at 12:41 AM
Omg, yes
"I feel like I've been taken for a loop"
OzToday at 12:43 AM
"we're in a heap of trouble"
TimmithToday at 12:43 AM
"I can't handle this much recursion"
OzToday at 12:44 AM
"it just recurred to me, I've been here before"
TimmithToday at 12:44 AM
Lol, perfect respawn statement
OzToday at 12:45 AM
"I could use a few pointers" (another death phrase)
TimmithToday at 12:46 AM
"I guess I missed the reference" (yet another death phrase)
OzToday at 12:46 AM
hahaha
TimmithToday at 12:46 AM
Meta-as-hell, I luv it
OzToday at 12:47 AM
"I've got a constant headache"
TimmithToday at 12:47 AM
So, I guess we're recording post-death phrases in the game, for sure
OzToday at 12:47 AM
We have no choice now
Can you put these in the concept doc?
TimmithToday at 12:47 AM

I'll just copy/pasta this thread
