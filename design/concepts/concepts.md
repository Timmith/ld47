# Interactables/Level Objects/Concepts: #

The Pool Of 'Static Memory':
    - is the level feature that acts as a timer/incentive for the player to complete the objective of 'breaking out of the loop' (completing the level)
    - it represents the memory being consumed (in RAM?) by the (for/while) loop as time goes on, slowly filling the level from bottom to top until it touches the player causing a 'blue screen of death' end/restart level sequence
    - once the level is completed, a sort of drain plug (or clog of code) (caused by the recursive loop) is removed and drains the deadly static memory out of RAM, allowing the player to slide down the side margins of code (like a fightfighter going the emergency exit pole) to the next level, where the next pool of deadly 'Static Memory' is executing slowly upwards

The Boolean Variable:
    - shoot it to toggle between a true and false state which controls a level (platform) element
        - maybe it could be the end element that the player (puzzle) platforms to and switches within the top line of code to fix/finish level
